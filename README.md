## Ways to Make API Calls

**What is an API?**
An Application Program Interface (API) acts as a source of communication between software programs. With the help of an API, a developer doesn't have to write the code from scratch. They can simply use an existing API that will save time and resources. Using an API also helps with software integration, which in turn improves the user experience. After developing an API, we make an API call to request resources from the server and perform other operations.

**What is an API call?**
An API call is a procedure by which information is exchanged. The client sends a request to an API. The API sends the request to the server and gets the response back to the client via that same API.

**REST API**
A Representational State Transfer (REST) API is the most common type of API, and many people often confuse the term API with the REST API. REST APIs allow you to perform CRUD (create, read, update, and delete) operations between a client and a server. It connects your backend with your frontend so they can communicate with each other.
